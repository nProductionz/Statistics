# Thesis: Online Algorithms (Data Streams): Ideas and Code

## Introduction

In the era of big data, traditional algorithms often struggle to efficiently process massive datasets due to limitations in memory and processing power. The emergence of data streams has prompted the development of "online" algorithms, which handle data in real-time as it arrives, offering scalable solutions for continuous data analysis.

## Objectives

This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of online algorithms for data streams, exploring both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. By bridging the gap between theory and application, the goal is to empower researchers and practitioners with the tools necessary to effectively analyze and extract valuable insights from continuously evolving data streams.

## Online Algorithms Overview

Online algorithms process data sequentially, making decisions on-the-fly without access to the entire dataset. This characteristic is particularly advantageous when dealing with continuous data streams, where the volume of information is vast and constantly evolving.

## Key Ideas

### 1. Streaming Algorithms

Streaming algorithms enable efficient processing of data streams with limited memory resources. Techniques such as sketching, sampling, and summarization play a pivotal role in extracting meaningful insights from continuous data.

#### 1.1 Count-Min Sketch

One exemplary streaming algorithm is the Count-Min Sketch, widely used for approximate frequency counting in data streams. Given a stream of elements $\(e_i\)$, the Count-Min Sketch maintains a table of counters, and for each element $\(e_i\)$, increments multiple counters using hash functions. The estimate of the count for $\(e_i\)$ is the minimum value among these counters.

$\[ \text{Count}(e_i) \approx \min_{j} \text{Counter}_{h_j}(e_i) \]$

This allows for a space-efficient way to estimate item frequencies in real-time, making it suitable for applications like network traffic monitoring and clickstream analysis.

### 2. Window-Based Approaches

Window-based strategies involve dividing the data stream into fixed-size windows, allowing for localized analysis. Algorithms like sliding windows and exponential decay windows are explored for their ability to adapt to changing data distributions.

#### 2.1 Sliding Window Mean Computation

Consider a sliding window of size $\(w\)$ over a data stream $\(x_i\)$. The mean at each step $\(t\)$ is computed as follows:

$\[ \text{Mean}_t = \frac{\sum_{i=t-w+1}^{t} x_i}{w} \]$

This sliding window mean computation is useful for monitoring trends and identifying anomalies in real-time. The algorithm provides a snapshot of the recent data, allowing for timely responses to changing patterns.

## Implementation

To illustrate the practical application of these concepts, code examples are provided in popular programming languages like Python.

### Count-Min Sketch in Python

```python
import mmh3  # MurmurHash3 library

class CountMinSketch:
    def __init__(self, width, depth):
        self.width = width
        self.depth = depth
        self.counters = [[0] * width for _ in range(depth)]

    def update(self, element):
        for i in range(self.depth):
            hash_val = mmh3.hash(element, i) % self.width
            self.counters[i][hash_val] += 1

    def estimate_frequency(self, element):
        min_count = float('inf')
        for i in range(self.depth):
            hash_val = mmh3.hash(element, i) % self.width
            min_count = min(min_count, self.counters[i][hash_val])
        return min_count

# Example Usage
stream_data = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
cms = CountMinSketch(width=5, depth=3)

for element in stream_data:
    cms.update(element)

frequency_estimate = cms.estimate_frequency(1)
print(f"Estimated frequency of element 1: {frequency_estimate}")
```

### Sliding Window Mean Computation in Python

```python
def sliding_window_mean(data_stream, window_size):
    window_sum = 0
    window = []
    means = []

    for value in data_stream:
        window.append(value)
        window_sum += value

        if len(window) > window_size:
            removed_value = window.pop(0)
            window_sum -= removed_value

        current_mean = window_sum / len(window)
        means.append(current_mean)

    return means

# Example Usage
data_stream = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]
window_size = 3
means_result = sliding_window_mean(data_stream, window_size)
print(f"Sliding Window Means: {means_result}")
```

## Simulations and Case Studies

### 1. **Real-time Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic**

Simulation studies have demonstrated the efficacy of online algorithms in real-time anomaly detection for network traffic. Algorithms like sketching and sliding windows prove instrumental in identifying unusual patterns and potential security threats as data streams through a network.

#### Mathematical Explanation

Consider a sketch-based anomaly detection algorithm using Count-Min Sketch. Given a stream of packet sizes \(p_i\), the sketch maintains counters using hash functions, and an anomaly is detected if the estimated frequency falls below a threshold.

$\[ \text{Count}(p_i) \approx \min_{j} \text{Counter}_{h_j}(p_i) \]$

#### Example Code: Sketch-Based Anomaly Detection

```python
import mmh3

class SketchAnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self, width, depth, threshold):
        self.width = width
        self.depth = depth
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.counters = [[0] * width for _ in range(depth)]

    def update(self, element):
        for i in range(self.depth):
            hash_val = mmh3.hash(element, i) % self.width
            self.counters[i][hash_val] += 1

    def detect_anomaly(self, element):
        estimated_frequency = 0
        for i in range(self.depth):
            hash_val = mmh3.hash(element, i) % self.width
            estimated_frequency += self.counters[i][hash_val]

        if estimated_frequency < self.threshold:
            return True  # Anomaly detected
        else:
            return False

# Example Usage
anomaly_detector = SketchAnomalyDetector(width=10, depth=5, threshold=100)

# Simulate network traffic
network_traffic = [150, 120, 130, 90, 110, 95, 105, 140, 200, 105]

for packet_size in network_traffic:
    anomaly_detector.update(packet_size)
    if anomaly_detector.detect_anomaly(packet_size):
        print(f"Anomaly detected in network traffic: {packet_size}")
```

### Predictive Maintenance Using Exponential Decay Windows

Simulations showcase the effectiveness of exponential decay windows for predictive maintenance in industrial settings. By analyzing sensor data in real-time, online algorithms can predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively.

#### Example Code: Exponential Decay Window for Predictive Maintenance

```python
def exponential_decay_window(data_stream, decay_factor):
    weighted_sum = 0
    total_weight = 0
    predictions = []

    for i, value in enumerate(data_stream):
        weight = decay_factor ** i
        weighted_sum = decay_factor * weighted_sum + value
        total_weight = decay_factor * total_weight + weight

        current_prediction = weighted_sum / total_weight
        predictions.append(current_prediction)

    return predictions

# Example Usage
sensor_data = [80, 85, 90, 82, 78, 75, 70, 100, 110, 115]
decay_factor = 0.9
predictions = exponential_decay_window(sensor_data, decay_factor)
print(f"Predictive Maintenance Predictions: {predictions}")

```
