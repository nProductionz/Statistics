# Probability Space #

A probability space is a mathematical framework used to model random experiments or events. It consists of three main elements: the sample space, the events, and a probability measure. Here's a brief explanation of each component and some simple examples:

### Sample Space (Œ©): ###
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. It is often denoted as Œ©. Each element in the sample space represents a possible outcome of the experiment.

#### Example: ####
Consider a simple coin toss experiment. The sample space for this experiment is {Heads, Tails}. In this case, Œ© = {Heads, Tails}. Each element in the sample space represents one of the possible outcomes.


### Events (ùìî): ###
Events are subsets of the sample space, representing specific sets of outcomes. Events can be simple (a single outcome) or composite (combinations of outcomes). Events are denoted as ùìî.

#### Example: ####
In the coin toss experiment, you can define events like:
A = {Heads} (the event of getting Heads)
B = {Tails} (the event of getting Tails)
C = {Heads, Tails} (the certain event, which is the entire sample space)


### Probability Measure (P): ###
The probability measure assigns a probability value to each event, indicating the likelihood of that event occurring. It is denoted as P. The probability measure must satisfy certain axioms, including the probability of the entire sample space being 1.

#### Example: ####
In the coin toss experiment, assuming a fair coin, you can assign probabilities as follows:
P(A) = 0.5 (the probability of getting Heads)
P(B) = 0.5 (the probability of getting Tails)
P(C) = 1 (the probability of any outcome in the sample space)
In this example, the sample space Œ© represents the two possible outcomes of a coin toss: Heads and Tails. Events A and B represent getting Heads or Tails, respectively, while event C represents the entire sample space. The probability measure assigns probabilities to each event, reflecting the likelihood of each outcome or event.

This framework is used to model and analyze random processes and allows you to calculate probabilities of various events and make informed decisions based on those probabilities.
