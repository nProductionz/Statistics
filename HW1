1. What is statistics and its relationship with other disciplines

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is a crucial tool for making informed decisions and drawing conclusions from numerical or empirical data. Statistics helps in understanding patterns, trends, and variability within a dataset, providing a foundation for informed decision-making in various fields.


2. Describe the concepts of variable, attribute, population, sample and dataset

In summary, variables are characteristics that can vary, attributes are the specific values a variable can take, the population is the entire group of interest, a sample is a subset of that population, and a dataset is the structured collection of data used for statistical analysis. These concepts are essential for conducting meaningful statistical research and drawing valid conclusions from data.


3. Briefly describe the main sampling techniques

Simple Random Sampling:

In this method, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. It is often done using random number generators or drawing lots. Simple random sampling is straightforward and minimizes bias.

Stratified Sampling:

The population is divided into subgroups or strata based on specific characteristics, and then random samples are drawn from each stratum. This method ensures that each subgroup is represented in the sample and is useful when there are distinct subpopulations.

Systematic Sampling:

In systematic sampling, every nth item from a list or sequence is selected to form the sample. For example, if you have a list of employees, you might choose every 10th employee.

Cluster Sampling:

In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters, and then a random sample of clusters is chosen. All members within the selected clusters are included in the sample. This is useful when it's difficult to sample individuals directly.


4. Briefly describe the main experiment designs

Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):

RCT is considered the gold standard in experimental design. Participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group (exposed to the variable being tested) or the control group (not exposed). Randomization helps minimize bias and allows for causal inference regarding the effects of the variable.
Pre-Post Test Design:

Participants are measured on the outcome variable both before and after exposure to the experimental treatment. Changes in the outcome variable are attributed to the treatment. However, without a control group, it's challenging to establish causality definitively.
Between-Subjects Design:

Participants are divided into different groups, and each group is exposed to a different level of the independent variable (e.g., high vs. low dose of a drug). The outcomes are compared between groups to determine the effect of the independent variable.
